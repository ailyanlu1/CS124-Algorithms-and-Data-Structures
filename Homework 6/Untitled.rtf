\f0\fs24 \cf0 Another similar way to show that the maximum flow of this graph is in fact $nk$ and thus running Ford Fulkerson will give a valid plant assignment is to show that the minimum cut of the graph must be $nk$.  To show the minimum cut is $nk$ it suffices to show that allowing $s$ to be in one partition by itself and all the other vertices are in the other partition.  Now can we add any other vertices to reduce the size of the minimum cut? Consider adding a row vertex $r_i$ to the partition. The sum of the outgoing capacities of $r_i$ is either greater than or equal to the ingoing capacity, $x$ and so adding $r_i$ will either not change the size of the minimum cut we currently have or increase it, which is not helpful.  Adding a column vertex $c_i$ would also be of little help because it would increase the }
